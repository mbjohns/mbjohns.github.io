# Radar Repair Challenge

## Mission Briefing
The radar system of the FrostByte Flyer, crucial for navigation and obstacle avoidance, has malfunctioned. You need to repair and recalibrate it using a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor to ensure safe travel through the Arctic skies.

## The Puzzle
Unfortunately the radar assembly is not intact, so you will need to reassemble it. Luckily you find some advanced aerospace adhesive (Blu Tack) which should do the job. Next, you will need to see to the radar's calibration. The servo motor that rotates the radar and the ultrasonic sensor that detects objects are not synchronizing correctly.

## Instructions
1. Examine the radar assembly and identify the connections for the servo motor and the ultrasonic sensor.
2. Connect the servo motor and ultrasonic sensor to your Arduino board.
3. Program the Arduino to control the servo motor, making the radar sweep back and forth, and use the ultrasonic sensor to detect objects at specific distances.
4. Adjust the calibration so that the radar accurately reflects the detection of objects.
5. Wire up a buzzer and led to notify you when an object is detected.

## Calibration Challenge
"To ensure a safe flight path, align the radar's wrath.  
When the distant bell chimes thrice, your calibration is precise."
