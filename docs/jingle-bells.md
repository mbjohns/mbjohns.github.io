# Radio Reactivation Challenge

## Mission Briefing
The FrostByte Flyer's communications system has been compromised following your crash landing. Your mission is to reactivate the radio to contact Santaâ€™s Command Center. The key to this challenge lies in a piece of tattered sheet music for "Jingle Bells," which you need to complete both in terms of notes and timing.

## The Puzzle
In the debris of the crash, you discover a fragment of sheet music. This crucial piece for "Jingle Bells" has some missing notes and lacks timing indications.

### Tattered Sheet Music




## Instructions
1. Determine the missing notes and their timing (quaver, semi-quaver, crotchet, etc.) to reconstruct the melody.
2. Connect the active buzzer to your Arduino board.
3. Program the buzzer to accurately play "Jingle Bells" with the correct notes and rhythm.
4. Demonstrate your solution to successfully complete the challenge.
