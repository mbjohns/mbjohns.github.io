# Dynamic Power Gauge Challenge

## Mission Briefing
The power gauge of the FrostByte Flyer, essential for monitoring the sleigh's energy levels, is not functioning. Your objective is to rebuild this gauge using a potentiometer, a 10-segment LED bar graph, and a 74HC595 shift register. This setup must be assembled on a separate breadboard and retained for use in subsequent challenges.

## The Puzzle
The power gauge is crucial for understanding the sleigh's current energy status. Using the potentiometer, you will control the LED bar graph to reflect varying power levels.

## Instructions
1. Set up a potentiometer on a separate breadboard as an analog input device.
2. Connect the 10-segment LED bar graph to the 74HC595 shift register and then to the Arduino, all on the same breadboard. Make sure to use resisters! 
3. Program the Arduino to change the LED display based on the potentiometerâ€™s input, simulating the fluctuating power levels of the sleigh.
4. Ensure that this breadboard setup is portable and can be integrated into future challenges.
